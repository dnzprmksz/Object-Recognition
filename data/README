Each Matlab mat file contains an array of structures where each structure
contains an object mask. Each structure has two fields:
- class_name: class of the object
- mask: binary mask for the object

For example, for image 1, "load 1.mat" will load the masks and will
create a variable called "masks" in the Matlab workspace. Image 1 has
three objects that were manually marked. "length( masks )" shows the number
of objects. "masks(1).class_name" contains the class label for object 1,
and "masks(1).mask" contains the binary masks for that object. You can view
the mask as "imshow( masks(1).mask )".
